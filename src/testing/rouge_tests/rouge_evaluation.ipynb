      "MADELEINE BRAND, host: I'm Madeleine Brand. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao is in Sichuan province today. He's inspecting the so called quake lake, that's a lake formed by landslides after last month's 7.9 earthquake.\r\n",
      "ALEX CHADWICK, host: Authorities have evacuated one quarter of a million people in the flood path of that lake. For some it's their second flight to safety, and still many are anxious to get back home. Jamila Trindle reports.\r\n",
      "JAMILA TRINDLE: Tua Hua Shan or Peach Blossom Mountain is really just a hill, but it's become a refuge for thousands of people from low lying villages nearby. If the dammed river upstream gives way and floods the valley, it should still be above water. For people staying here, it's been three weeks of fear and uncertainty. After living through one disaster and fleeing the threat of another.\r\n",
      "Mr. WEN FONG: (Through translator)  Everyone wants peace and quiet, but the quake and the flood makes everyone here nervous. If the situation continues like this, our hearts won't be able to take it anymore. It's so terrible.\r\n",
      "JAMILA TRINDLE: Wen Fong (ph) says he has nightmares about the quake, the aftershocks, and now the flood, too. A local TV station has wired up a television. A few people are gathered around waiting for news about the lake that still threatens to flood their towns. Others have retreated into the woods nearby to get out of the heat. At first glance, with parents playing cards and kids running through the trees, it looks like everyone's just out here for a day in the country. Though it all appears carefree, when I asked the kids what they've been doing these days, they're quick to answer avoiding disaster. The adults are laughing and chattering around their card game, maybe out of nervousness. They say they're constantly anxious. Wong Guen Quay(ph) says she's still scared, even here.\r\n",
      "Ms. WONG GUEN QUAY (Earthquake Survivor): (Through translator) I worry about a bigger earthquake or flood coming. Maybe this place where we're staying will also be destroyed. After the quake, you know, my legs are always soft. It's like I'm swaying in the wind when I walk. All day my brain is nervous and my heart feels like it's going to stop.\r\n",
      "JAMILA TRINDLE: When she heard they'd have to evacuate again, Wong couldn't believe it.\r\n",
      "Ms. WONG GUEN QUAY (Earthquake Survivor): (Through translator) It's crazy. The quake isn't finished, but the flood is coming.\r\n",
      "JAMILA TRINDLE: And yet they all say they'll go back.\r\n",
      "Ms. WONG GUEN QUAY (Earthquake Survivor): (Through translator) How could we leave? Even the migrant workers who left are coming back. It's our home. Of course if flooding destroys the houses, we'll have to leave. If not, we prefer to stay there.\r\n",
      "JAMILA TRINDLE: Wong says life will be hard, even if they can go back. They'll still have to live in tents. But they're hoping they can harvest the crops left in the fields when they fled. That's one of their biggest concerns right now. For some of them, it's all they have. And they all agree they're grateful the government is providing for them until it's safe to return. Jo Gui Ti(ph) is hoping that it's soon. He's an official for a nearby village. Jo sits tallying numbers in front of a blue tent labeled Tai Bai(ph) Village Office.\r\n",
      "Mr. JO GUI TI (Tai Bai Village Official): (Through translator) People are definitely more anxious here. Not only the farmers, but also the officials are quite anxious. We really hope that the people can return to their homes as soon as possible. You know, inside the tent it's too hot so it's hard to do anything in there.\r\n",
      "JAMILA TRINDLE: He says his village was one of the first to be evacuated, so they've been here for ten days and the financial loss in terms of crops keeps mounting. As the women around her voice their anxieties, Wong Guen Cheun(ph) tries to put things in perspective.\r\n",
      "Ms. WONG GUEN CHUEN (Earthquake Survivor): (Through translator) Of course we're very anxious about staying here too long. Our crops are still in the fields and we can't harvest them. But most importantly we're safe. That's the point. Life is the most important.\r\n",
      "JAMILA TRINDLE: For NPR news, I'm Jamila Trindle in Sichuan province. \n",

      "REFERENCE SUMMARY: China's devastating earthquake in May left almost 70,000 dead and five million homeless. Thousands of the displaced people are now being evacuated again as rivers clogged with debris threaten to overflow. One such camp is on Peach Blossom Mountain near Jiangyou.\n",

      "MADELEINE BRAND, host: I'm Madeleine Brand.\r\n",
      "MADELEINE BRAND, host: In a few minutes, writer Pete Hamill remembers the last day of his friend Robert F. Kennedy.\r\n",
      "ALEX CHADWICK, host: First, John McCain, yes, John McCain - the other presidential candidate. He gave a major speech last night. That's what his campaign called it. He was in the city of New Orleans. Here he is.\r\n",
      "Senator JOHN MCCAIN (Republican, Arizona): I strongly disagreed with the Bush administration's mismanagement of the war in Iraq.  I called for the change in strategy. I called for the change in strategy that is now, at last, succeeding, where the previous strategy had failed miserably.\r\n",
      "Senator JOHN MCCAIN (Republican, Arizona): I was criticized. I was criticized for doing so by Republicans. I was criticized by Democrats. I was criticized by the press. But I don't answer to them. I answer to you.\r\n",
      "ALEX CHADWICK, host: John McCain, the candidate of change but the right kind of change, he said last night. Former presidential speechwriter David Frum joins us by phone in Barcelona, where he is today. David, what did you think of that speech?\r\n",
      "Mr. DAVID FRUM (Columnist, National Review): Well, the McCain speech as a document was just terrific. It hit every point that John McCain needed to hit. And it did something very subtle.  While paying lots of compliments to Barack Obama personally, it dealt with the age issue that Obama subtlety raises against John McCain all the time by complimenting him on his half century of service to the country. John McCain raised it by saying, well, Barack Obama may be young, but his ideas are old.\r\n",
      "ALEX CHADWICK, host: I heard him say, it's surprising to hear a young man turn to the past for failed ideas.\r\n",
      "Mr. DAVID FRUM (Columnist, National Review): Exactly. Now, the only thing that could have made the speech better is if we lived in an age where people absorbed political oratory from the newspaper because when you read the speech, it's just a perfect document. Unfortunately, we've invented radio and television and people hear it and see it, and it was not delivered with the kind of power and conviction that a speech so powerful and conviction-filled ought to have been delivered with.\r\n",
      "ALEX CHADWICK, host: So as you look ahead at the campaign, how is that going to play into things?  Senator McCain is a - enormously sympathetic political figure for many, many Americans, but as an orator, as someone who has to get up and excite a crowd, he's not a match as a candidate for Senator Obama.\r\n",
      "Mr. DAVID FRUM (Columnist, National Review): No, but he really doesn't need to be. I mean, I have a very simple map of what I think is happening in this election. The country is ready for a change and is ready to sweep out the incumbent party, the Republicans, if the alternative is acceptable. And the great question over the rest of the election is, is the alternative acceptable? And John McCain is John McCain. He is very much a known quantity.\r\n",
      "Mr. DAVID FRUM (Columnist, National Review): They know he was right about the war, and they know he got the tactics right. The surge was his idea. They know he is not on top of this economic issue and that's a problem, but he's known, and they respect his integrity and his record. Now you have this other candidate who is much less known and then you have this third force, Hillary Clinton, who I thought last night was sort of vowing to conduct a guerilla warfare campaign - we've lost the main battles, but I'm going to lead my band of party fighters up in to the hills and the war continues. And depending on how destructive she is, she may play a major part in convincing the country that the alternative to the incumbent is unacceptable, or at least impossible.\r\n",
      "ALEX CHADWICK, host: You write in the National Review online today that she may be campaigning for the vice presidency and if she is, that Senator Obama would find it almost impossible to say no, but very inadvisable to say yes.\r\n",
      "Mr. DAVID FRUM (Columnist, National Review): Look, Mitt Romney is campaigning for the vice presidency. He's going around the country. He's making speeches. He's saying nice things about John McCain. Hillary Clinton is doing a little bit more than that. She's got 2,000 delegates or thereabouts. She is delivering a speech - I'm not giving up. Now, the question she is posing to Obama is, nice little convention you are going to have there in Denver, it would be a true misfortune if it were to be ruined by a whole series of challenges over credentials of Michigan and Florida.\r\n",
      "Mr. DAVID FRUM (Columnist, National Review): I mean, I could turn this thing into the worst convention since the Democratic convention of 1968. Would you like me to do that? If not, you'd better think about ways to make me happy. This is not campaigning for the vice presidency. This is putting a pistol to the man's head and - so, it's not an abstract question for Obama.\r\n",
      "ALEX CHADWICK, host: You know, this strikes me, David, we called you to talk about John McCain, and here we are still talking about Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Maybe if they go on, Senator McCain will never get any attention and it will just be them.\r\n",
      "Mr. DAVID FRUM (Columnist, National Review): But this election really is about them. I really do think there is very little the Republicans can do to win this election. But there is a great deal the Democrats can do to lose it and so far, they are doing many of those things.\r\n",
      "ALEX CHADWICK, host: David Frum, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, and he writes a column for National Review online. David, thank you again.\r\n",
      "Mr. DAVID FRUM (Columnist, National Review): Thank you. \n",
      "\n",
      "REFERENCE SUMMARY: Former George W. Bush speechwriter David Frum says John McCain's major speech on Iraq was a \"perfect document,\" but its impact was dulled by a less-than-powerful delivery.

      "MADELEINE BRAND, host: From NPR News, this is Day to Day.\r\n",
      "MADELEINE BRAND, host: Finally, some relief from those relentless rise in oil prices. The price of a barrel of crude is now more than $10 below last month's record highs, but some industries are finding that the damage has already been done. They're making some big changes in the way they do business.  Joining us now is Marketplace's Bob Moon. Bob, first, why are oil prices falling now?\r\n",
      "BOB MOON: Well, hallelujah, Madeleine, crude does keep dropping. It's been trading at around $122 a barrel today. Compare that to the record high we saw just two weeks ago, when oil hit a record of $135.09a barrel. Some of this is driven by signals from the Fed, that it's through cutting interest rates for now. That could help shore up the value of the dollar, and that could help stabilize oil prices since most oil is priced in dollars.\r\n",
      "BOB MOON: But the big factor in today's price decline is the latest word that we've gotten from the Energy Department on gasoline demand. It says that there was a sharp fall-off last week, and demand's been declining over the past four weeks, really, by almost one and a half percent. That's helped push gasoline inventories up by almost 3 million barrels. Now that's more than three times the increase than analysts were generally expecting.\r\n",
      "MADELEINE BRAND, host: So, if there is more gas, does that mean that the prices will go down?\r\n",
      "BOB MOON: Well, not necessarily right away. The average price for regular gas right now across the country has now hit a record of 3.98 a gallon. Many analysts think that's likely to hit four bucks in the coming days. Of course here in California, we're already paying well over that amount.\r\n",
      "MADELEINE BRAND, host: So, what about these problems that the high oil prices are causing for certain businesses?  What's happening?\r\n",
      "BOB MOON: Well, the airline industry is really struggling with the cost of doing business and just today, we've gotten word from United that they're going to make aggressive moves to cope with fuel prices. They are cutting 1,100 more jobs, and United is going to ground 70 more of its fuel guzzlers. That means it's mothballing its entire fleet now of 94 Boeing 737s along with six 747s. And United's going to be cutting its mainline domestic capacity by up to 18 percent in the next year. And then move over to the auto industry. another sign of these belt-tightening times. The Ford F -series pick-up truck, it's been the best-selling vehicle in America for the past 17 years. Well, last month, it wasn't. The Honda Civic and the Accord and Toyota's Camry and Corolla all outsold Ford's pick-up. And then just yesterday, GM said it would be closing down some SUV plants. It's retooling to meet shifting consumer demands.\r\n",
      "MADELEINE BRAND, host: So, is this temporary or long term, do you think, these changes?\r\n",
      "BOB MOON: Well, analysts and industry officials are telling us that these are fundamental changes in the ways these companies are going to be doing business. Here's how one auto market analyst puts it. He says he's never known the market to change this much, this quickly, in his lifetime.\r\n",
      "MADELEINE BRAND, host: Wow. Thank you, Bob. Bob Moon of Public Radio's daily business show, Marketplace. \n",
      "\n",
      "REFERENCE SUMMARY: United Airlines announces plans to lay off about 1,000 workers and ground some planes. And for the first time in 17 years, imported compact cars last month outsold Ford F-series pickups. Marketplace's Bob Moon discusses the sea change in the U.S. economy.\n",

      "RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: It's time now for our series Hanging On, where we take a look at the economic pressures of American life. This week, we're looking at the minimum wage because it's on its way up to $15 an hour in California and New York, which is an unprecedented wage bump at the state level. And it's going to have an effect both on workers and employers. NPR's Hansi Lo Wang has more.\r\n",
      "HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: Shopping these days is a little easier on Edica Reese's wallet. She works as a cashier at a McDonald's in New York City, where the minimum wage is on the rise.\r\n",
      "EDICA REESE: It's helping. I guess I can get more essentials. Before, I couldn't get what I needed.\r\n",
      "HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: Sometimes she would have to ask neighbors for toilet paper when she ran out. But now she and other fast-food workers in the city are making at least 10.50 an hour. That's set to go up to $12 an hour at the end of the year.\r\n",
      "HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: And that means she can afford to keep up her own stock of toiletries.\r\n",
      "HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: Are you finished shopping?\r\n",
      "EDICA REESE: Yes, I am.\r\n",
      "HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: But it's going to be a while before the minimum wage finally hits the planned $15 an hour. That's because the wage hikes in New York state and California are being phased in with small bumps every year. Reese says 15 an hour would make a big difference for her and her 3-year-old daughter.\r\n",
      "EDICA REESE: I guess I could pay my bills on time instead of waiting for the next check to come and the next check. I live check to check still. I need to save a little bit more money, you know?\r\n",
      "HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: For a full-time worker, a year's salary at 15 an hour, before taxes, adds up to just over $31,000. And some employers say they're not sure how they're going to afford it, including Kurt Samuels. He owns Family's Pots and Grill, a Jamaican restaurant in Mount Vernon, N.Y., where, at 5:30 in the morning, he starts making...\r\n",
      "KURT SAMUELS: Brown stew chicken, curry goat, oxtail, and soon I'll have some jerk chicken ready.\r\n",
      "HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: This is all for the lunch rush?\r\n",
      "KURT SAMUELS: For the lunch rush.\r\n",
      "HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: Samuels has one part-time employee who helps take orders. She's currently making the minimum wage, and he says when it goes up...\r\n",
      "KURT SAMUELS: It's going to be hard, you know? Maybe her hours most likely going to be cut, you know, 'cause the end of the day, got to pay the rent, pay the bills, the gas, light, insurance.\r\n",
      "HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: He recently raised prices, but he's worried about losing customers if he does it again.\r\n",
      "HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: A few blocks away, Miesha Stokley is trying to figure out how to keep staffing her cupcake shop. She has one minimum-wage worker who helps with baking.\r\n",
      "MIESHA STOKLEY: She's definitely worth minimum wage, so I can't argue with that. I just have to, you know, work harder so we can make more money and I'll be able to pay. But I don't argue with it because it's expensive to live in New York.\r\n",
      "HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: For now, Stokley's putting more hours in herself at Cupcake Cutie Boutique.\r\n",
      "MIESHA STOKLEY: I work nights as a nurse. So I'm here in the morning and the afternoon, and then I go to work at night.\r\n",
      "HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: So when do you sleep?\r\n",
      "MIESHA STOKLEY: I barely sleep (laughter).\r\n",
      "HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: It's part of the pressure many other small-business owners are facing in cities, including Seattle and Washington, D.C., where the minimum wage is also rising to $15 an hour. But lawmakers and economists are paying extra attention to the wage bumps in New York state and California.\r\n",
      "LINDA BARRINGTON: For most economists, this is untrodden territory.\r\n",
      "HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: Linda Barrington heads Cornell University's Institute for Compensation Studies. She says it's hard to predict how raising the minimum wage at the state level will impact New York and California's economies. That's because past studies have not looked at increases this big and that affect this many people. Besides workers and employers, though, she says we should keep an eye on how these wage hikes will affect prices.\r\n",
      "LINDA BARRINGTON: The more that businesses can pass it along to consumers, the less it's going to negatively affect employment.\r\n",
      "HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: Those consumers, of course, include minimum-wage workers. That's partly why some critics of minimum-wage hikes say increases are not effective tools for reducing income inequality. Still, Barrington adds, any increase will touch not only fast-food chains and other large-scale industries but also those on the smaller scale, like families hiring a home health care worker.\r\n",
      "HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: For Edica Reese's family, though, it's a change that can't come soon enough. She lives in a public housing development in Harlem, where she pays $300 a month for a small studio apartment she shares with her daughter, Kayleene.\r\n",
      "EDICA REESE: And you like the fight for 15, right?\r\n",
      "KAYLEENE: Uh-huh.\r\n",
      "HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: Kayleene went to rallies with her mother, where she and other fast-food workers protested for minimum wage increases.\r\n",
      "EDICA REESE: What do you say?\r\n",
      "KAYLEENE: What do you want? Fifteen. When do you want it? Now. We don't get it, shut it down.\r\n",
      "EDICA REESE: Yay.\r\n",
      "UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Yay.\r\n",
      "HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: Workers in Arizona, Colorado, Maine and Washington are also calling to raise their state's minimum wages, though to a few dollars shy of 15. Those hikes will be on the ballot on November 8.\r\n",

      "RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: A couple of weeks ago, some residents of Coudersport, Pa., got some strange packages delivered to their homes with flyers inside them from the Ku Klux Klan. Coudersport is a small town of about 2,500 people in the northern part of Pennsylvania. Jaimi Hajzus grew up there. And she lives a couple of hours away now, but she got all kinds of concerned messages from friends about these packages.\r\n",
      "RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: So she teamed up with Coudersport resident Joe Leschner who started a Facebook group to gather information and help fight the KKK's presence in that town. Jaimi Hajzus joins us now from Franklin, Pa.\r\n",
      "RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Welcome to the program.\r\n",
      "JAIMI HAJZUS: Hi.\r\n",
      "RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: So what did the fliers say specifically?\r\n",
      "JAIMI HAJZUS: It said something like, are you concerned about what's going on in town? - and something like, you can sleep tonight because the KKK is watching.\r\n",
      "RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: So it was some kind of recruitment tool?\r\n",
      "JAIMI HAJZUS: I think so. I don't think that they were trying to make people feel safer.\r\n",
      "RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Is there a history of Klan activity in that town or in that area?\r\n",
      "JAIMI HAJZUS: Unfortunately, yes. There's a little bit of history there. When I was growing up in Coudersport in the 1990s, a man named Augusts Christ lived there and was active in the white supremacy movement. He would often harass anti-racist church leaders, neighbors and community members. We saw more activity through the 1990s, where people from out of town were coming in town to gather for these white supremacist events. August Christ then moved out of Potter County around 1999. You know, we had kind of 16 - 15, 16 years of peace and quiet in Coudersport. And then - and now this.\r\n",
      "RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: So how did residents respond when they got these things?\r\n",
      "JAIMI HAJZUS: People are upset. This isn't the sort of thing that we, as a small town, want to be known for. It is primarily white town, and we would like to be known for hunting and fishing. And we have an ice mine and other touristy-type attractions. And I think we've worked really hard to overcome this negative press (laughter). So it's disheartening to have it come back.\r\n",
      "RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: You said it's a predominantly white town. Are there African-Americans or other minority families who live there? And have you reached out to them to understand how they're processing this?\r\n",
      "JAIMI HAJZUS: There are some. And actually, Joe Leschner took up the cause because he realized that members of his own family were feeling scared and threatened. Joe's wife is from Jamaica. And she felt scared, and he didn't like that at all.\r\n",
      "RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: The Facebook group that you guys have started is called Twin Tiers for Racial Equality. How are you using the space, and what's your goal?\r\n",
      "JAIMI HAJZUS: We want to send a message that this hateful rhetoric is not welcome in our town. But also, we're trying to start a movement about saying things out loud to other white people. So white people need to stop talking the talk and start walking the walk in terms of how we behave towards our black and brown friends and neighbors, beginning with the words that we use and how we behave in our daily lives with other white people and including how we vote.\r\n",
      "JAIMI HAJZUS: A big part of our campaign is this hashtag, #sayitoutloud, which means that we confront racism in real time right away when we see it or hear it. So one of our most important jobs as white allies is to confront our white friends and families when they are being racist.\r\n",
      "RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: There have been reports of similar packages, like the ones that were delivered to the residents of Coudersport, these things showing up at people's houses across the country. Are you hearing from a lot of people outside Pennsylvania who found your Facebook group?\r\n",
      "JAIMI HAJZUS: Yes, actually. We started hearing from people in Kansas and in other places, mostly sort of intensely rural small towns where there might be literally one or two people. But they've decided to take up this cause and try and threaten and harass their friends and neighbors.\r\n",
      "RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Jaimi, have you gotten any threats as a result of this work?\r\n",
      "JAIMI HAJZUS: No. The thing that I experience the most, honestly, in this kind of activism, in this kind of work, is silence. This is why I really need for our white people to start talking and need them to start speaking up. You know, they'll tell me that it's a political issue. It's not a political issue. The rhetoric that's being flung around right now is unacceptable, and that needs to be said loudly.\r\n",
      "RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Jaimi Hajzus is co-founder of a Facebook group out of Pennsylvania called Twin Tiers for Racial Equality.\r\n",

      "FARAI CHIDEYA, host: How big of a difference does three weeks make?\r\n",
      "FARAI CHIDEYA, host: Well, three weeks ago, federal sentences for crack cocaine were much tougher. Then, new guidelines from the U.S. Sentencing Commission took effect, bringing the penalties more in line with what some advocates say is fair. But what about people already serving their sentences? Are those too lengthy?\r\n",
      "FARAI CHIDEYA, host: Well, the commission is now considering whether to reduce prison terms for thousands of people in jail for crack cocaine offenses.\r\n",
      "FARAI CHIDEYA, host: Later on the show, we'll speak with someone who opposes retroactive resentencing.\r\n",
      "FARAI CHIDEYA, host: But first, Mark Mauer. He's executive director of the Sentencing Project and he thinks that convicts already serving sentences should get theirs reduced, which means some would be let out of jail.\r\n",
      "FARAI CHIDEYA, host: Welcome.\r\n",
      "Mr. MARK MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project): Hi. Thanks. Good to be here.\r\n",
      "FARAI CHIDEYA, host: So, explain this. A person arrested for crack cocaine offense on October 31st, a federal offense, would get a different sentence from someone who got theirs on November 1st?\r\n",
      "Mr. MARK MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project): Exactly. You know, the crack cocaine laws go back to the mid-1980s and punish crack cocaine offenses far more harshly than powder cocaine. And the U.S. Sentencing Commission, recognizing this disparity, has modified the sentences somewhat, but for people sentenced as November 1st.\r\n",
      "Mr. MARK MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project): So, essentially, someone who is sentenced on October 31st might have gotten a 10-year sentence for crack offense. A similar person sentenced on November 1st is now getting roughly a nine-year sentence. And the question is, is there any justification for making those different or should we make it retroactive to people who've already been sentenced and are sitting in prison right now.\r\n",
      "FARAI CHIDEYA, host: As part of this whole debate over crack and powder cocaine, these reduced sentences or the reduced guidelines would still have much higher penalties for crack cocaine, correct?\r\n",
      "Mr. MARK MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project): Far higher. One quick example. There's a guy in prison right now by the name of Willie Mays Aikens. He's a former baseball star for the Kansas City Royals, played in the World Series, subsequently became addicted to drugs and started selling drugs and sold to an undercover agent. He was convicted of a crack cocaine offense and is in the middle of doing about a 20-year sentence. If this proposal goes through, to make it retroactive, he'll have about three years, cut-off in his sentence. He'll still do 17 o 18 years. If he'd been convicted of selling powder cocaine, he would have gotten a sentence about two and a half years only. That's the magnitude of the difference we're looking at.\r\n",
      "FARAI CHIDEYA, host: So the Sentencing Commission is taking this up now. When could we expect a decision?\r\n",
      "Mr. MARK MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project): Well, some people have heard that they may make a decision in January. They can do it at anytime, so it's likely within the next month or two. They had a full day of hearings this week, heard very broad variety of views. So I think all the information that they need to look at this issue is certainly before them right now.\r\n",
      "FARAI CHIDEYA, host: How does race play into this convictions over crack and powder cocaine?\r\n",
      "Mr. MARK MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project): Well, race is fundamental to the whole policy. You know, back in 1986 when these laws were adopted by Congress, we have this relatively new drug that had come on the scene, crack cocaine. And the image of that - the crack user, whether or not it was entirely correct - was that of a young black male, sometimes young black female. I mean, we have cover of Newsweek magazine and similar - lots of stories on television. That was the image that came across.\r\n",
      "Mr. MARK MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project): And the Congress passed the crack cocaine mandatory sentencing laws, really, in record time. There are virtually no hearings held, no discussion about - with experts in the field who knew something about addiction or treatment. And it's hard to escape the fact or the conclusion that the rush to judgment had something to do with the perception of the person who is being affected.\r\n",
      "Mr. MARK MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project): It's intriguing to note that the Sentencing Commission has previously made retroactive changes for other drug sentencing laws, particularly for marijuana and LSD, where they change the law that made it retroactive.\r\n",
      "Mr. MARK MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project): Those changes primarily benefited white defendants. Here, the estimates are 85 percent of the people who would benefit from crack retroactivity would be African-Americans. So it's a very stark contrast before us.\r\n",
      "FARAI CHIDEYA, host: Do you, in your mind - although, you're advocating this - see any downside to potentially releasing people who have already been convicted under existing laws?\r\n",
      "Mr. MARK MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project): Well, you know, there are some people who make the charge that -well, we'd be releasing dangerous people out in the community. Some of these people have had weapons involved in their offense. Some of them have been convicted also of obstruction of justice and the like. That's equally true for people convicted of powder cocaine or a heroin offenses or anything else, and yet, we routinely let people out of prison every day.\r\n",
      "Mr. MARK MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project): Many of the people sentenced for these crack cocaine offenses will have served 10, 15, even 20 years or more before they're let out. And so if we can't come up with some way to provide these people with job skills, with life prospects after that many years in prison, that points to a much more fundamental problem.\r\n",
      "Mr. MARK MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project): It seems to me they've paid far too much in terms of punishment for the crimes they committed. The question now is how do we prepare them for release to live at more constructive lifestyle when they get out. And I think we have an opportunity to take advantage of that now.\r\n",
      "FARAI CHIDEYA, host: Well, Marc, thank you so much.\r\n",
      "Mr. MARK MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project): Thanks for having me.\r\n",

      "BRIAN UNGER: Oprah Winfrey is on the cover of Black Enterprise Magazine this month. Now you probably remember when she was on the cover back in 1986, and you're asking, hey, Oprah, what has changed since then? Well, the answer according to Oprah, nothing. In 22 years, Oprah says nothing about her has changed. In Oprah's world, there's still a Camaro in her driveway. Kurt Waldheim is president of Austria, and bacon is $1.75 per pound. Nothing has changed.\r\n",
      "BRIAN UNGER: But what she does say is very interesting. Oprah says, quote, \"I've evolved.\" Oprah has evolved right into her brand new yet to be launched very own cable TV network, called \"OWN\" which is going to be on the air very soon because an hour of Oprah a day is just not enough.\r\n",
      "BRIAN UNGER: So how do we know, or how does Oprah know she's evolving? And what will she look like to archeologists in one million years, when they find petrified Oprah in a forest, will they say, \"she was very evolved?\" Is evolving painful? More importantly, who can evolve and who can't? Well, I can tell you that I'm pretty sure I'm evolving too. Into a new more expensive apartment next week and it hurts. Now I'm not changing addresses, I'm evolving into a new address because I got robbed at my old address. Two gang bangers standing in my driveway with all my stuff in their van caused me to evolve.\r\n",

      "RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is at war with the National Enquirer and its parent company, AMI.\r\n",
      "DAVID GREENE, HOST: Yeah. Bezos laid out this explosive allegation in a post on the blog site Medium last night. In it, Bezos says the tabloid's owner, David Pecker, was trying to blackmail him. In the post, he writes, quote, \"rather than capitulate to extortion and blackmail, I've decided to publish exactly what they sent me despite the personal cost and embarrassment they threaten.\"\r\n",
      "DAVID GREENE, HOST: Now, Bezos says the company was threatening to release intimate photos of him in an effort to stop him from finding out how the National Enquirer had obtained his private photos and text messages documenting an extramarital affair. Bezos also implies here that the reason for the blackmail is that he is the owner of the Washington Post, which has been dogged in its reporting about President Trump.\r\n",
      "RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: So much to talk about here. NPR's Uri Berliner is here to help us understand this story. Hi, Uri.\r\n",
      "URI BERLINER, BYLINE: Hey, Rachel.\r\n",
      "RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: So David mentioned there some intimate photos revealing an extramarital affair. Can you tell us more about what exactly the National Enquirer had on Bezos?\r\n",
      "URI BERLINER, BYLINE: Yeah. They said they had a series of photographs of Bezos and Lauren Sanchez, the woman that he had been having an affair with, very sexually suggestive, lewd photographs that they were threatening to publish unless Bezos backed off from his investigation into how AMI, the parent company of the National Enquirer, obtained those photographs. And that's - he really wanted to find out how those personal texts and photos leaked.\r\n",
      "RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Right. So in this long Medium post, Bezos just publishes some of the emails that he says are from AMI. What do they say?\r\n",
      "URI BERLINER, BYLINE: Yeah. So Bezos, you know, basically says, OK, you've got these photos on me. I've got these emails from you, from officials from AMI. And basically, they're saying that they want Bezos to stop investigating. One of them from an AMI official proposes some terms to end the dispute with Bezos. It says it will agree not to publish any of the texts or photos. But in exchange, Bezos must say that AMI's coverage of his affair was not politically motivated. The other email described some of those suggestive photos that we've been talking about.\r\n",
      "URI BERLINER, BYLINE: I reached out to AMI for comment. I've not heard back from them. But Bezos in his post says there is a political motivation here.\r\n",
      "RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: I mean, let's just spend a second talking about that. There are all kinds of political threads to this, right? As we noted, like, David Pecker is a good friend of Donald Trump's. And Jeff Bezos is the owner of the Washington Post, a paper that has been pretty critical and aggressive in the reporting over Donald Trump, right?\r\n",
      "URI BERLINER, BYLINE: Absolutely. The Post has been very aggressive in its reporting of Trump. Trump has also feuded with Amazon, the company that Jeff Bezos founded. He claims they get all kinds of breaks. They're not paying their fair share of taxes. So this has been an ongoing feud between between President Trump and Bezos, who owns the Post and founded Amazon.\r\n",
      "RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: And remind us about the National Enquirer's connection to the investigations into Donald Trump because David Pecker was granted immunity in the investigation into Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen because Pecker was involved into those illicit payments to Karen McDougal, right?\r\n",
      "URI BERLINER, BYLINE: Right. The National Enquirer acknowledged paying hush money to a former Playboy model who said she had an affair with Trump. She was paid 150,000 during the 2016 campaign. And so that's really what happened there.\r\n",
      "RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: He also refers to his ownership of the Post as being a complexifier for him, which is an odd word. But, I mean, what more does he say about his role as the owner of the Post?\r\n",
      "URI BERLINER, BYLINE: He says, (laughter) yeah, it's a complexifier, difficult, but he has no regrets about owning the Post. And it's - he says it's - when he looks back on his life, owning the Post and supporting its mission is something he'll remain proud of at age 90.\r\n",

      "RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: The U.S. Supreme Court has blocked the state of Louisiana from implementing a restrictive new abortion law before then ruling on its constitutionality.\r\n",
      "DAVID GREENE, HOST: Yes. So this ruling right now puts a temporary stay on the law, which means clinics that perform abortions can keep operating for the time being until the court does rule on the constitutionality.\r\n",
      "RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Supreme Court reporter Amy Howe is with us to talk through the ruling and the dissent because there was some. Amy, thanks for being here.\r\n",
      "AMY HOWE: Hey, good morning. Thanks for having me.\r\n",
      "RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: First, before we talk about the implications, what exactly would this law do in Louisiana?\r\n",
      "AMY HOWE: A lot of it depends on exactly how it plays out. And that is part of Justice Brett Kavanaugh's dissent, which we can talk about. But the opponents of the law say that if the law's allowed to go into effect, there'd only be one doctor to provide abortions in the early stages of pregnancy and none at all for women seeking abortions after 17 weeks of pregnancy.\r\n",
      "RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: You mentioned Justice Kavanaugh's dissent. What did he say?\r\n",
      "AMY HOWE: So he was the only one who wrote to explain why he would have denied the stay that the opponents of the law were seeking. He would have allowed the law to go into effect. There were four justices altogether - Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch in addition to Kavanaugh all said they would deny the stay and allow the law to go into effect.\r\n",
      "AMY HOWE: But what Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the court's newest justice, wrote is that a central legal question in the case is whether this requirement that doctors who perform abortions in Louisiana have to have admitting privileges will impose an undue burden, which is the legal standard for whether a law violates the Constitution, on a woman's right to have an abortion depends on a factual question, whether the doctors in this case can actually get admitting privileges.\r\n",
      "AMY HOWE: And that's disputed. The District Court in this case, the trial court, said that they wouldn't be able to, and the Court of Appeals said that they would be able to. And so what Justice Kavanaugh said is instead of putting the law on hold and speculating about this, let's figure it out during the 45-day transition period because if the doctors can get admitting privileges, there's no undue burden, and the law should be allowed to stand. If they can't, he said, they can come back to court.\r\n",
      "AMY HOWE: And this would be faster than doing it the way the court's going to do it, which ultimately probably will wind up with a decision sometime in the summer of 2020.\r\n",
      "RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Interesting.\r\n",
      "AMY HOWE: Yeah.\r\n",
      "RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Let me ask you about how it broke, though - 5 to 4. John Roberts, the chief justice, sided with the liberals. Was that surprising?\r\n",
      "AMY HOWE: It was, yes. To be sure, the court was not writing on a blank slate because in 2016, the Supreme Court had struck down a similar law from Texas. But in that case, it was Justice Anthony Kennedy who joined the court's former liberal justices, and the chief justice, John Roberts, was actually in dissent. We don't know what his reasoning was to vote this - to vote with the four more liberal justices last night. But we do know that he's an institutionalist. So even if he might believe that the law is constitutional in a vacuum, perhaps this Texas case from three years ago says otherwise.\r\n",
      "RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Amy Howe reports on the Supreme Court for the SCOTUSblog. Amy, thanks for being here this morning. We appreciate it.\r\n",
      "AMY HOWE: Thanks for inviting me.\r\n",
      "RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: The will-he-or-won't-he debate is over. Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker goes before the House Judiciary Committee today.\r\n",
      "DAVID GREENE, HOST: Yeah. House Democrats have been eager to press Whitaker on his interactions with President Trump and his oversight of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, even threatening to subpoena him if he didn't show up. Whether he'll answer their more sensitive questions about the investigation is, of course, another matter, but we'll find out. House Democrats are feeling emboldened with their new majority. This is House Oversight Chair Elijah Cummings on Wednesday at a hearing on strengthening ethics rules for the executive branch.\r\n",
      "ELIJAH CUMMINGS: The American people gave this Congress and this committee a mandate to restore our democracy and clean up our government.\r\n",
      "RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: All right. For more on House - on how House Democrats are using their newfound power, we've got NPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell in the studio. Good morning, Kelsey.\r\n",
      "KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: Good morning.\r\n",
      "RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: So first off, let's talk about Matt Whitaker. The acting AG is going to go before the Judiciary Committee today. What are they going to ask him?\r\n",
      "KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: Well, first of all, this happened after a week of kind of back-and-forth. Whitaker originally threatened not to show up because Democrats on the committee were essentially threatening to subpoena him. But he agreed to appear last night. And Democrats say they want to ask him specifically about the Russia investigation.\r\n",
      "KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: They are going to ask lots of questions. They're probably going to touch on things like the child separation policy or potentially about immigration and health care. But this will be largely about the Russia investigation, how much people know about it and how much the - inside of the attorney general's office, how much they're talking to the president about that. And it'll be public, so we'll watch that happen.\r\n",
      "RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: This hearing with Whitaker comes at the end of a week where Democrats started to follow through on campaign promises to investigate the president, to investigate his administration. One of those promises - Democrats have pledged to look into Trump's tax returns. Is that going to be part of this oversight push?\r\n",
      "KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: It absolutely is. We just don't know how fast it's going to move. Just the other day, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that she was - wanting people to be cautious. She wants people to be careful about this because sensitive tax returns are a really serious thing, and releasing them quickly has a lot of potential implications and potential legal implications if the president decides not to comply.\r\n",
      "KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: But, you know, it's important to think about this in the context of broader oversight that Democrats want to do. They are moving forward from the shutdown. And they want to spend their time making sure that they make good on promises to investigate this president, and this week was all about that.\r\n",
      "RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Is - does that jeopardize their other agenda items? Because they're not just about investigating the president, right?\r\n",
      "KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: They say that it doesn't. They want to do other things. They want to make health care more affordable. They want to have conversations about climate change. But really, when you are - Democrats are the - only controlling the House. They don't have power over the Senate or the White House. So it's hard to legislate. Doing these investigations allows them to put their stamp on everything - on guns, on child separation, like we talked about, and even on the environment.\r\n",
      "RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Meanwhile, I can't let you go without asking about the border security talks because there is this panel of lawmakers who are trying to come up with a border security agreement to avert yet another government shutdown. Are they making progress?\r\n",
      "KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: We are told that things are looking good and that they are negotiating in good faith, but a deal is not in hand yet. And I've been told by some people privately that they think that they might need a little bit more time than just next week. So this could get extended if they can't get a deal in the next couple of days.\r\n",

A Madea Halloween,\" has a 5 percent rating, but the franchise has been a huge financial success. How do you explain all of that?\r\n",
      "LISA FRANCE: Because people love to hate Madea movies.\r\n",
      "ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: (Laughter) OK.\r\n",
      "LISA FRANCE: It's kind of like a black family reunion. Like, you know someone's going to embarrass you, but you also know you're going to have a great time. So I think it's one of those things where people just don't want to admit how much they enjoy Madea films. And even if they really don't like them, they still like to hate-watch them. They make a lot of money. You don't want to be left out of the conversation when somebody is talking about the latest Madea film.\r\n",
      "ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: What is it about the character that inspires both the love and the hate?\r\n",
      "LISA FRANCE: Well, you know, Spike Lee has gone on record as saying that the films are kind of like coonery and buffoonery, as he said, that he feels like it's very stereotypical to have this angry black woman. But for many people, it also reminds you of your grandma or your auntie, you know, those people who say whatever. They use their age to their advantage to be able to, you know, curse you out or let you have it. And it's just a very divisive character because on some levels, it's very historical, but on others, it feels very stereotypical.\r\n",
      "ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: These films all have certain themes in common. There's often kind of a family narrative, sometimes a moralistic or Christian streak. Sometimes Madea does kind of - almost, like, public service announcements. This clip is from \"Madea's Family Reunion.\"\r\n",
      "TYLER PERRY: (As Madea) When you get tired of a man hitting on you, honey, ain't nothing you can do but cook breakfast for him. Bring him into the kitchen, and get you big old pot of hot grits. And when it starts to boil like lava after he had got good and comfortable, you say good morning. Throw it right on him.\r\n",
      "LISA FRANCE: I mean, right there you have the dichotomy that is Madea - on one hand, incredibly loving, looking out for someone who's being abused but, on the other hand, also violent (laughter). So...\r\n",
      "ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Abuse is a frequent topic in a lot of these movies, which seems like a heavy subject to tackle in slapstick humor. What do you think is the value of returning to it again and again in film after film?\r\n",
      "LISA FRANCE: I think because it's one way for us to have the discussion and, in a way, try to keep it light. You know, people want to see the reality of life and African-American life and what happens in families, but they also want some levity to it. So I think by using humor, Tyler Perry has been able to open people's eyes and allow people to have the conversation which would otherwise be extremely uncomfortable to have.\r\n",
      "ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: All right, well, we're talking about this because Tyler Perry says this weekend's movie, \"A Madea Family Funeral,\" will be the last one in the franchise. Do you believe him?\r\n",
      "LISA FRANCE: I don't.\r\n",
      "LISA FRANCE: The reason is while he says that he's tired of portraying Madea and he has a new deal with a new studio; he's using that as an opportunity to kind of leave Madea behind, these movies make so much money. And I just feel like it's going to be a Michael Jordan situation. Michael Jordan said that he was going to retire, and that was it. And then Michael Jordan turned right around and came back. So I think there's going to be a sense that at some point, Madea is going to have to come back.\r\n",
      "ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: OK, so I just want to be clear here. It seems like you're saying Tyler Perry as Madea is the Michael Jordan of film. Do I understand you correctly here?\r\n",
      "LISA FRANCE: (Laughter) Are you going to quote me on that, Ari, really?\r\n",
      "ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: I think you're on the record with that. I think we've got that on tape. America is going to hear you saying that.\r\n",
      "LISA FRANCE: I think I'm going to go ahead and stand by that because when he comes back to play again, you'll say Lisa France said it.\r\n",
      "ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Lisa France, senior entertainment writer with CNN Digital, thanks a lot.\r\n",
      "LISA FRANCE: Thank you so much, Ari. \n",
